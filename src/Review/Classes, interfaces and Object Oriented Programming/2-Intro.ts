/*Object oriented programming is one of the many programming paradigms (styles of programmming)
    in which objects are the building blocks of applications.

    These programming paradigms are styles or ways of writing code. They are not programming languages.
    Different programming languages support different programming paradigms.
    
    For example, JavaScript and TypeScript both support some object oriented and functional programming techniques.
